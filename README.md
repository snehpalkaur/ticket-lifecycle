Intake

User Ken creates a ticket:

Open a Ticket



Ticket assignment

Support agent John Doe logs in (I typed in the wrong password in this screenshot so ignore "access denied"):

Support agent login



Communication

Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.

He makes sure to leave a proper message:

Communication



Working the issue

System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:

Sys admin agent login

Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.

She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:

Working the issue



Resolution

Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>

Working the issue



And there you have it. This was just a very simple scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, assignment and communication of a ticket between agents, and ultimately it's resolution.

There many other scenarios that can happen during the handling of a ticket. Sometimes a ticket has to be reassigned to a different department. Other times it's priority needs to be escalated. Or sometimes it needs to be both reassigned and escalated.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand what can typically go on behind the scenes of a help desk department. During any given day, help desk agents can have anywere between just 10 tickets all the way up to hundreds of tickets in their pipeline. So if this is something you'd like to do, just keep that in mind.
